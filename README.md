# University of Rochester Biomedical Data Science Hackathon Summer 2022

# Logistics

<!-- 0.   Registration is open until 12PM Friday 8/19.  Teams can consist of up to 4 people. Register by using the google form. -->
0.   Each team must have a github handle associated with it in order to participate.  Make sure you edit your registration or email the organizers to provide this, if you haven't yet.
1.   You may add team members up
to noon EDT on 8/21 by editing your response to the google form or emailing the organizers.
2.  Teams of entirely undergraduates will be in the undergraduate
division, else they will be in the open division.
3.  Predictions on test data set are submitted by pushing to
    github.  A repository with the name `Hackathon-Summer-2022`,
    owned by the team captain, will
    be queried for a file named [prediction/prediction.csv](prediction/prediction.csv).  **If the team captain forks this
    repository and writes predictions there everything should work
    (as long as the predictions are formatted correctly).**
2.  Predictions will be scored at least once daily, starting 8/23, with
    scores posted by noon.  At
    the organizers' option, predictions may be scored more frequently
    than this.
2.  General questions/problems can be directed to [issues](https://github.com/Rochester-Biomedical-DS/Hackathon-Summer-2022/issues) page.  We encourage other hackathon participants to respond to issues.
3.  The scoreboard will be located
    [here](https://rochester-biomedical-ds.github.io/Hackathon-Summer-2022/Leaderboard.html), and will be updated starting noon on 8/23.
    We  cannot provide support
    beyond the diagnostic output included on the scoreboard if an error is
    encountered in scoring your predictions.
5.  Interim scoring may employ forms of randomization (e.g. bootstrapping) from the test data set.  The final scores will use all the data and not be randomized.
4.  Competition runs through 11:59 PM EDT 26-August-2022.  The predictions each team has committed to their repository at that time will be used to determine their final score.
